        <h1>Project 2: Mini WMS</h1>
        <p>The project that shows how the goods can be stored and traced inside warehouse.</p>
		<p>The main key aspect of the project was to develop a desktop application that utilized a cloud-based SQL server on Azure to manage the storage, repacking, and tracking of goods delivered to a warehouse. These goods would be stored for a certain period and then shipped to their final destination. The business model centered on renting warehouse space, with charges based on the storage time of the goods. A critical element of this project was the need for many interconnected tables to handle the data and enable actions like creating, updating, or removing records through the desktop software. While the technology stack could vary depending on specific goals, the core of the project relied on the SQL tables and the data models designed during the application's creation.</p>
		<p>The application also required the integration of multiple technologies into one project and the handling of large amounts of data. Although the project was meant to serve as a proof of concept, its complexity allowed me to learn the fundamental principles of database architecture and basic SQL commands for data manipulation. Even though the software was built using the .NET framework, I employed a simple library called ADO.NET to interact with the SQL database. This library required me to create a data model as well as methods for manipulating the database. These methods involved executing various SQL commands, which necessitated a basic understanding of the SQL language.</p>
		<p>Overall, the project was a significant learning experience, and it has already influenced how I plan to handle data in future projects, which I am eager to begin.</p>
