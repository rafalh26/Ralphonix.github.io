        <h1>Project 1 - The Game Data Spreadsheet</h1>
        <p><h2>Overview:</h2></p>
		
<p>The project was inspired by a friend's request to find the best item for either a Stamina boost or a Health boost in the game. Although the game provides some in-game descriptions for each consumable item, there is no data available that can be easily sorted or manipulated to obtain specific information. My primary focus, therefore, was to gather data based on the information provided by existing sources, such as the website https://paxdei.gaming.tools/ and the item's descriptions in the game itself. Collecting and organizing this information in a sorted and structured manner required careful consideration of how to implement it into an Excel file, making use of sorting, filtering, and other common tools. I also kept in mind the possibility of transferring all this data into an SQL server database later on, which influenced my approach to the architectural structure, including the use of key SQL elements like foreign keys and constraints.</p>
<p>For the Excel spreadsheet, I employed functions such as VLOOKUP, hyperlinks, and other common tools to achieve similar results as querying a database, without actually using one. The project was divided into sections, where each section could correspond to a table in SQL Server. The key sections: <ul><li>the stats sheet</li><li>the crafting info</li></ul>Sheet are distinct from one another due to their different approaches.</p>
<p>In the crafting info sheet, I aimed to ensure that each item had a single line, with columns defining the ingredients. This approach imposed some limitations, such as a fixed maximum number of ingredients determined by the number of columns, but this was sufficient for my needs. Since the data is relatively static and unlikely to change frequently, the limitations are acceptable. The stats sheet, on the other hand, provides straightforward information about the bonus stats an item gives. Understanding that SQL allows for easy grouping of items by column, I created a group ID index, referring to a table for the single crafting skill that each item belongs to. This ensured a unique primary key while grouping all items by their ID from their original table, such as the Baking sheet ID.</p>
<p>Key tools such as VLOOKUP, INDIRECT, and data validation (select from list) were used to ensure the data's accuracy and validity in most cases. Although some fields are modified manually, the overall sheet is flexible enough to allow easy addition or removal of items. Furthermore, it is designed to be expandable, enabling the addition of more complex data and tools in the future. In summary, I believe I achieved my goal, creating a simple and easy-to-implement template for future development in SQL Server or possibly even a C# application. This project demonstrated that it is possible to achieve database-like results, such as sorting data, within Excel using the available information.</p>
